	Most of what I want to accomplish in fall 2022 is self-improvement. Primarily, I want to get back into a routine that isn't just 
school and home. I used to be burnt out from high school and now I find myself craving to be part of an organization again to fill time
and make connections. I'm hoping this helps give me more initiative which so far has been true.

	I've reached my first goal to participate in Mechatronics but now I want to maintain this energy. I want to contribute as much as
possible to electrical and business. I want to help in financial data for business and develop control systems in electrical. 

	More personally, I want to improve my WPM when reading and typing... and I want to get better at rhythm games and FPS'. /)v(\
