This is just a very preliminary test of FIR digital bandpass filter design. I used the filter creator in MATLAB (DSP Systems Toolbox) to create the FIR coefficients and sample sine wave. sampleData is about 40kHz and sampleData2 is about 8kHz. Since this is just test code, you can switch between the two waveforms by adding a 2 after the sampleData in the convolution funciton call.
