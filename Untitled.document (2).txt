Hi, I’m Khalia.


About me: I’m a freshman Computer Engineering Major. 
I have always wanted to get into robotics which is why I decided to get involved in this club. 
I don’t have any experience in building really and don’t know anything about electrical. But you have to start somewhere and I’m more than willing to learn. 
Also, I did build a device in an invention internship, it wasn't anything near as complicated as the robo sub though. 


Goals for fall 2022:
Ultimately my goal is to learn as much as I can (thats all the time though not just fall)
I want to stay on top of my work and get good grades
Increase my productivity
