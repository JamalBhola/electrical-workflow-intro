Hey SDSU Mechatronics team. My name is Zaid Yasin and I'm a junior COMPE major. I've always had a passion for computers & tinkering, and having a small amount of experiencetesting embedded driver configurations has made me very interested in embedded systems development & serial communications. Outside of school, I play and compose music, spend time with my partner, and tinker with electronics & instruments repair. For the current semester, my goals are mainly just to bridge the knowledge gaps I had due to learnign over the pandemic, branch out in terms of interests within my major, and make new connections with other engineers :) looking forward to having a great two years with y'all.
