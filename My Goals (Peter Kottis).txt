My name is Peter Kottis and I am a senior majoring in Electrical Engineering.

My goal is to apply to as many internships as I can, so that I will be able to get experiences
before I obtain a career. I also want to refine my understanding of Power & Energy/DSP as 
they are two of the paths I want to pursue when I graduate.

Thus, my interests in the club are either power and energy and/or DSP (or related to signals).
