Hi there! My name is Brendan, and I'm a Senior EE student at SDSU. I love working with electronics, soldering, 3d modelling, and reverse engineering. One of my goals for Fall 2022 is to get involved with Mechatronics to see what it's like working with others on an engineering project. I've worked in a professional environment with teams before, but not with engineering. I look forward to working with everyone!
