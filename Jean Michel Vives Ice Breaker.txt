Hi :) I'm Jean Michel Vives, electrical team lead. 

I'm a senior at SDSU this semester majoring in electrical engineering. I love listening to music and  mountain biking. Cooking is also one of my best skills. 

My goals for this semester are to integrate some advanced sensors on our robosub platform.
